/**
This protocol is implemented by all Stock Fighter types that are used to parse responses from the Stock Fighter API.  The responses are returned as NSDictionary types therefore all types must have an initalizer that parses a NSDictionary object.  This protocol specifies one computed property and one initializer

    ----
    
    __Parameters__
    *ok - Is a boolean value that specifies if the request did what was expected

    ----

    __Initializers__
    *init(dict: NSDictionary) - Should parse the NSDictionary object that represents the response from the server.
