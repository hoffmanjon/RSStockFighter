/**
    This protocol is implemented by all Stock Fighter requests.  Each type that conforms to the this protocol should represent a seperate API in the Stock Fighter system.  If we need additional functionality for Post or Get requests we will use protocol composition to include the requirements from this protocol.

    In order conform to this protocol a type must implement the two computed properties.

    ----

    __Parameters__
    * url - The url computed property is a constant that will represent the url of the request
    * requestType - The requestType computed property is a constant that specifies whether the request is a GET or a POST request

/**
  This protocol takes the requirements from the _StockFighterRequestType_ protocol and adds an additional method that will generate a JSON string which will be used to send the data to the StockFighter API.

    ---

    __Parameters__ (from the _StockFighterRequestType_ protocol)
    * url - The url computed property is a constant that will represent the url of the request
    * requestType - The requestType computed property is a constant that specifies whether the request is a GET or a POST request

    ----

    __Methods__
    * getJsonString - If the request is a post request then the body needs to contain the data for the request in JSON format.  This function should generate a String value, in JSON format, that contains the data for the request.
